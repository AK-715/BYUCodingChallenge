# BYUCodingChallenge

I have spent 4 hours to finish the project. 
I followed the instructions, but there are some things that I could do better.
First, it counts every letter when checking the answer, so at the end, it shows at least the length of the answer word. 
Second, it doesn't check the duplication , so if a player imputs two same incorrect letter, it counts as two incorrects.
